# COMP-9517-Project
The group project of COMP 9517 (Cell Tracking and Analysis)

## Pull Notice
1. DO NOT upload the image fills, as it is inefficient. Everyone must put their cells' images under the Sequence/ folder.

## Task 1 Segment and Track Cells
### Task 1-1 Segment all the cells and show their contours in the images as overlays.

### Task 1-2 Track all the cells over time and show their trajectories (also called tracks, paths, histories) as overlays.

## Task 2 Analyze Cell Motion
### Task 2-1 The cell count (the number of cells) in the image.

### Task 2-2 The average size (in pixels) of all the cells in the image

### Task 2-3 The average displacement (in pixels) of all the cells, from the previous image to the current image in the sequence.

### Task 2-4 The number of cells that are in the process of dividing

## Usually TODOs
Each group can meet with their assigned tutor once per week in Weeks 6-9 during the usual consultation session on Thursdays 7-8pm to discuss progress and get feedback.

## Final TODOs
1. Prepare a 10min video demo for the lecture of Thursday 18 November 
  - Everyone must participate and be responsible for different parts of the demo
  - After the tutors have watched and marked the video, we MUST be ALL present to ask questions from other students
2. A report to submit before 19 November 2021 23:55:00.
